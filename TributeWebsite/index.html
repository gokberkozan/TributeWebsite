            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Friedrich Nietzsche (born October 15, 1844, Röcken, Saxony, Prussia [Germany] — died August 25, 1900, Weimar, Thuringian States) was a German classical scholar, philosopher, and critic of culture, who became one of the most influential of
                all modern thinkers. His attempts to unmask the motives that underlie traditional Western religion, morality, and philosophy deeply affected generations of theologians, philosophers, psychologists, poets, novelists, and playwrights. He
                thought through the consequences of the triumph of the Enlightenment’s secularism, expressed in his observation that “God is dead,” in a way that determined the agenda for many of Europe’s most-celebrated intellectuals after his death.
                Although he was an ardent foe of nationalism, anti-Semitism, and power politics, his name was later invoked by fascists to advance the very things he loathed.</p>
